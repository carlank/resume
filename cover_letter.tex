\begin{cvletter}
\\
When I first saw this job posting, I almost laughed out loud. Not at the content, mind you, but at how perfectly it described what I want and love to do. I started my career in the foodservice industry and discovered, in the years to follow, a passion for optimizing and automating the systems around me. At Bean Sprouts, I worked to link our inventory management and POS systems together to provide expected remaining inventory based on sales. By identifying the high-loss areas, and in combination with other changes, I managed to reduce our overall shrinkage by approximately 75\%, while reducing labor spent on inventory by nearly half.\\
While that's unmistakably trivial compared to what Compeat is doing, the focus on innovation and integration of disparate elements to streamline the end-user experience really resonates with me. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application; I would relish any opportunity to meet and discuss how I would be of benefit to Compeat.
